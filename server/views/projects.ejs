              Payroll Management System is the system that i created with the
              team of full 6 members of team in 4 months time period. We created
              this application as a standalone application which is designed in
              C# and the back end of the database is structured by the SQL
              database. It has three users for now but depends upon the
              usuability the user canc change that to the way he/she likes to
              change

              Hospital management system is the ongoing project that we started
              in january 2019 during my last semseter.This is the stand alone
              software that should be developed in the point of view that only
              be used in the hospitals but can be applicable in any hospitals,
              the front end is done by using the C# as my first project and the
              User Interface is designed using the forms from the Visual Studio
              platform which grants easy and felxible user interface. Further
              more, the backend that is databse will be Sql which will hold all
              the data.

              Soccer League is the website that i designed that helps the coach
              to add his/her team into the system and schedule the matches. The
              website provides full access over the CRUD (Create, Reterive,
              Update and Delete) of coach, teams, players and the match
              schedules. The website is designed with C# in Visual Studio
              platform and all the information is stored into the SQL server
              that can be further portabe to the cloud services if there is a
              need for the extension of the website over the internet with high
              level of the users.

              I created this project on my own without any external help of any
              class mate so all the work of development, documentation and
              planning is done by me, it took alot of time but it all worth the
              end result.
